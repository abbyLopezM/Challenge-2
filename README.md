## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
The motivation for this project was to create a student's work porfolio to help when applying to jobs or to be more noticed in the job field. This project was built to have a place to consolidate all projects and display them in a more effective way. The problem was a lack of a work porfolio. I learned that it is important to have a work portfolio.

## Installation
The project is a website so we only need to deploy it. We can open the code development via VS Code to change anything on the website

## Usage

The website is a student porfolio that employers can navigate and see the students work.
